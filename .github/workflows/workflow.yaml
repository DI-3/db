#Terraform typcal workflow includes - terraform init terraform validate terraform fmt terraform plan  terraform apply
#
#In my scenario, I want two things to happen:
#
#Plan: When a pull request is received, a GitHub Workflow is triggered to perform a security audit,
#construct Google Cloud credentials, load the Terraform CLI, and perform an init , fmt and plan using the
#proposed files in the pull request. Finally, I want a comment on the pull request to show the results of the plan step.
#Apply: When a push is received in the master branch, I can assume that the proposal
#was accepted and the new code should be applied.
#I again wish to construct Google Cloud credentials and load the Terraform CLI.
#However, the final steps will be to apply the configuration.
